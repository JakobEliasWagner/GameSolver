## Numbers Round
In the numbers round the goal is to put five numbers into a math formula, which equates to a goal.
Each number can only be used once.
In the classic implementation of the game only the operations addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are allowed.
The players can choose to set brackets however they choose and however many they want.
Can the goal not be achieved the closest player wins.
The numbers are chosen at random with two categories.
High numbers are multiples of 25 and low numbers between 1 and 10.
One contestant can choose how many high and how many low numbers they want.
The total number of numbers is 6.
